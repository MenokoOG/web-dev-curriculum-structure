## **Steps and Key Concepts**

### **1. Initial Setup**

- **Inspecting Tools**: We'll use the application tab in DEV tools to check local storage and the React DEV tools to inspect state.
- **Current State**: Our sign-up and login functions only console log `res.data`. We'll update this to set user state.

### **2. Updating State**

- **Login Function**: We'll extract the user and token from `res.data` and set the user state.
- **State Preservation**: We'll ensure the user state updates correctly without losing any existing data.

### **3. Persistent State with Local Storage**

- **Problem**: User state is lost on page refresh.
- **Solution**: Save user data and token in local storage.
- **Implementation**:
    - Use `localStorage.setItem("token", token)` to save the token.
    - Use `localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user))` to save the user as a JSON string.

### **4. Loading State from Local Storage**

- **Initialization**: Check local storage for user and token when the app initializes and set the state accordingly.
- **Code Addition**:
    - Use `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"))` to retrieve and parse the user data.
    - Use `localStorage.getItem("token")` for the token.

### **5. Practical Implementation**

- **Testing**: Log in and check that the user and token persist in local storage and state, even after page refreshes.
- **Updating the Profile Component**: Display the username on the profile page by consuming the context from the user state.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **State Management**: Properly managing state ensures a seamless user experience across sessions.
- **Local Storage**: Using local storage allows user data to persist beyond a single session, solving the issue of state loss on refresh.
- **Context and Components**: Effectively use context to manage and display user data across different components.

## useNavigate()

The `useNavigate` hook in `react-router-dom` is another essential tool for managing navigation programmatically in React applications. It provides a more flexible and imperative approach to routing compared to the declarative `Navigate` component. Here are some reasons why `useNavigate` is important:

### Benefits of `useNavigate`

1. **Imperative Navigation**: `useNavigate` allows you to navigate to different routes imperatively, which is useful in functions or event handlers where a component cannot directly return JSX elements.
2. **Complex Navigation Logic**: It provides more flexibility for complex navigation logic that might involve conditionally determining the next route or performing side effects before navigation.
3. **Dynamic Routing**: With `useNavigate`, you can dynamically construct the path to navigate to, making it easier to work with routes that require parameters or query strings.
4. **Consistency with Hooks**: It fits well within the React Hooks ecosystem, allowing you to use the same pattern for navigation as you do for state and side effects.

# **Goals of Adding Password Security and Handling Automatic Routing Using Tokens**

## **Password Security**

### **Goals:**

1. **Protect User Credentials**: Ensuring that passwords are stored securely prevents unauthorized access to user accounts. By hashing passwords before storing them, even if the database is compromised, attackers cannot easily retrieve the original passwords.
2. **Prevent Data Breaches**: Proper password security minimizes the risk of data breaches. Strong hashing algorithms make it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer passwords, thus protecting users' personal information.
3. **Maintain User Trust**: Implementing robust password security measures helps build and maintain user trust. Users are more likely to use and recommend a platform that prioritizes their security and privacy.
4. **Compliance with Best Practices**: Adhering to password security best practices, such as using bcrypt for hashing, ensures that the application meets industry standards and legal requirements for data protection.

## **Handling Automatic Routing Using Tokens**

### **Goals:**

1. **Seamless Authentication**: Using tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), allows for seamless authentication across the application. Once a user logs in, they receive a token that can be used for subsequent requests, eliminating the need to repeatedly enter credentials.
2. **Stateless Sessions**: Tokens enable stateless authentication, meaning the server does not need to store session information. This reduces server load and simplifies scaling the application.
3. **Enhanced Security**: Tokens can be signed and optionally encrypted, ensuring that only authorized parties can access protected resources. Tokens also support expiration times and can be invalidated if necessary, adding an extra layer of security.
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Tokens can carry encoded user information, including roles and permissions. This allows the server to enforce role-based access control (RBAC), granting or restricting access to resources based on the user's role.
5. **Improved User Experience**: Automatic routing using tokens enhances the user experience by allowing users to remain authenticated as they navigate the application. This creates a smoother and more intuitive interaction flow.

## **Summary**

Incorporating password security and token-based authentication into our application serves multiple goals, from protecting user credentials and maintaining trust to enabling seamless and secure access to resources. By prioritizing these aspects, we ensure a robust and user-friendly authentication system that meets modern security standards.
