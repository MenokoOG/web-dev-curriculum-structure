# Explanation of Code Interaction: Axios Request with Authentication

The provided code blocks illustrate how axios, specifically `userAxios`, is utilized to facilitate authenticated requests from the frontend to the backend, specifically for fetching user-specific issues. Let's explore how these blocks work together to achieve this functionality.

## `userAxios` Configuration

```jsx
const userAxios = axios.create();

userAxios.interceptors.request.use(config => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    return config;
});

```

- **Configuration**: `userAxios` is created using `axios.create()` to customize axios instances.
- **Interceptors**: An interceptor is added to `userAxios` to modify outgoing requests. Here, `localStorage.getItem('token')` retrieves the JWT token stored in the browser's localStorage.
- **Authorization Header**: The interceptor sets the `Authorization` header on every request with the retrieved token, ensuring authentication for protected routes.

## `getUserIssues` Function

```jsx
async function getUserIssues() {
    try {
        const res = await userAxios.get('/api/main/issues/user');
        setUserState(prevState => ({
            ...prevState,
            issues: res.data
        }));
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
}

```

- **Functionality**: `getUserIssues` is an asynchronous function that fetches user-specific issues from the backend.
- **axios GET Request**: It uses `userAxios` (configured with the token interceptor) to send a GET request to `/api/main/issues/user`.
- **State Update**: Upon receiving a successful response (`res.data` contains the fetched issues), `setUserState` updates the frontend state to reflect the fetched issues.
- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling to log any encountered errors to the console.

### Interaction and Workflow

1. **Frontend Request (getUserIssues)**:
    - The frontend calls `getUserIssues`, which uses `userAxios` configured with the token interceptor.
    - The interceptor automatically adds the JWT token to the request headers.
    - This ensures that the backend can authenticate and authorize the request based on the user's token.
2. **Backend Route (GET '/user')**:
    - Upon receiving the GET request at `/api/main/issues/user`, the backend extracts the user's ID (`req.auth._id`) from the JWT token.
    - It queries the database for issues where the `userId` matches `req.auth._id`.
    - The found issues are returned as a response (`foundIssues`).
3. **Data Flow**:
    - Frontend receives the response from `userAxios.get` in `getUserIssues`.
    - It updates the `userState` to display the fetched user-specific issues on the frontend interface.
    - Any errors encountered during the process are logged to the console for debugging purposes.

### Conclusion

Through these interconnected code blocks, `userAxios` ensures that authenticated requests from the frontend securely reach the backend, where backend routes handle these requests by querying and returning relevant data based on the user's authentication token. This setup allows for efficient and secure communication between the frontend and backend while maintaining user privacy and data integrity.
