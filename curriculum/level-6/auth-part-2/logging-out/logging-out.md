## Importance of Logging Out a User from Local Storage and `userState`

### **1. Security**

- **Prevent Unauthorized Access**:
    - Removing the token from local storage ensures that users cannot access protected routes after logging out.
    - Clearing `userState` removes user information from the application's memory, preventing potential security breaches.

### **2. Consistency**

- **State Synchronization**:
    - Ensures the application's UI accurately reflects the user's authentication status.
    - Prevents stale state issues where the UI might show incorrect information about the user's logged-in status.

### **3. User Experience**

- **Clear Feedback**:
    - Redirecting users to the home page or login page after logging out provides clear feedback that they have been successfully logged out.
    - Prevents confusion and enhances the overall user experience.

## Summary

- **Logout Function**:
    - Removes user data from local storage.
    - Clears `userState` to update the application state.
    - Uses `navigate` to redirect the user, ensuring they are logged out and cannot access protected routes.
