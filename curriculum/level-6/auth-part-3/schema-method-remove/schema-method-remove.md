# Securing User Data: Removing Passwords from User Objects in Token-Based Authentication

In this lesson, we will discuss the importance of removing passwords from user objects when creating tokens and sending user data to the client. This practice is crucial for maintaining security and protecting sensitive information.

## Why Remove Passwords from User Objects?

When handling user authentication and session management, it’s essential to ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords, is not exposed. Even if a user's password is hashed and stored securely in the database, sending this hashed password to the client can pose security risks. Removing passwords from user objects before sending them to the client is a best practice that helps prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

## The Code: Removing Passwords from User Objects

Let's examine the following code block, which defines a method to remove the password field from a user object in a Mongoose schema:

```jsx
userSchema.methods.withoutPassword = function() {
    const user = this.toObject();
    delete user.password;
    return user;
}

```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this code works:

1. **Defining a Method**:
The `userSchema.methods.withoutPassword` function is defined as a method on the user schema. This method can be called on instances of user documents, enabling each user object to utilize this method.
2. **Converting to Plain JavaScript Object**:
Inside the method, `const user = this.toObject();` converts the Mongoose document into a plain JavaScript object. This is necessary because Mongoose documents have additional properties and methods that are not present in plain objects.
3. **Deleting the Password Field**:
The `delete user.password;` statement removes the `password` field from the user object. This ensures that the password is not included in the data sent to the client.
4. **Returning the User Object**:
Finally, the method returns the modified user object without the password field.

## Practical Usage

When a user logs in or registers, their information is often sent back to the client as part of the response. Here’s an example of how the `withoutPassword` method might be used in a route handler:

```jsx
authRouter.post('/login', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const user = await User.findOne({username: req.body.username})
        if (!user){
            res.status(403)
            return next(new Error("Incorrect Username or Password"))
        }

        const passwordCheck = await user.checkPassword(req.body.password)
        if (!passwordCheck){
            res.status(403)
            return next(new Error("Incorrect Username or Password"))
        }
        const token = jwt.sign(user.withoutPassword(), process.env.SECRET)
        return res.status(201).send({user: user.withoutPassword(), token})
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500)
        return next(error)
    }
})

```

In this example:

- After verifying the user's credentials, the `withoutPassword` method is called to remove the password from the user object.
- A token is generated using the user data that does not include the password.
- The token and the sanitized user data are sent back to the client.

## Security Considerations

Removing passwords from user objects before sending them to the client provides several security benefits:

- **Prevents Exposure**: Ensures that even hashed passwords are not exposed to the client or potential attackers.
- **Reduces Attack Surface**: Minimizes the amount of sensitive information transmitted over the network.
- **Follows Best Practices**: Aligns with security best practices for handling user data in authentication systems.

By adopting this approach, you enhance the overall security of your application and protect user information from potential threats.

In conclusion, the practice of removing passwords from user objects before sending them to the client is a simple yet effective measure to improve security in token-based authentication systems. Using methods like `withoutPassword`, you can ensure that sensitive information remains protected, maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of your application.
