# **Understanding the Issue Schema**

In this section, we define the `issueSchema` using Mongoose, which outlines the structure of the Issue model in our application. This schema is crucial for ensuring consistent and valid data storage for issues created by users.

## **Functionality**

### **Schema Definition**

- **Fields**:
    - `title`: A required string that represents the title of the issue.
    - `description`: A required string that provides a detailed description of the issue.
    - `imgUrl`: An optional string that can store a URL to an image associated with the issue.
    - `userId`: An ObjectId that references the User model, linking the issue to a specific user.

### **Mongoose Integration**

- The schema is defined using Mongoose's `Schema` class, which allows for the creation of a structured schema for MongoDB documents.
- The schema is then used to create a Mongoose model named "Issue", which is exported for use in other parts of the application.

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Data Structure**: The `issueSchema` defines the structure and data types for issues, ensuring that each issue has a title and description, and can optionally include an image URL.
2. **User Association**: By including a `userId` field that references the User model, the schema establishes a relational link between issues and users, allowing for user-specific issue management.
3. **Validation**: The schema enforces validation rules, such as requiring the title and description fields, to maintain data integrity and consistency.
4. **Mongoose Models**: The schema is used to create a Mongoose model, which provides a powerful interface for interacting with MongoDB and performing CRUD operations on issue data.

This schema forms the backbone of our issue management system, enabling the creation, storage, and retrieval of issue data in a structured and consistent manner.
