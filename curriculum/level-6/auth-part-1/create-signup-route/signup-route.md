# **User Registration Endpoint**

The `/signup` endpoint is a crucial part of the authentication system of our application. It handles the registration process for new users, allowing them to create an account and gain access to the system.

## **How it Works:**

1. **User Check:** Upon receiving a POST request to `/signup`, the server first checks if the requested username is already taken. This is done by querying the database to find a user document with the provided username. If a user with the same username already exists, the server responds with a status code of 403 (Forbidden) and an error message indicating that the username is already taken.
2. **User Creation:** If the requested username is available, the server proceeds to create a new user object based on the data provided in the request body. This user object typically includes information such as username, email, password (hashed for security), and any other relevant user data. The password is securely hashed before being stored in the database to ensure the security of user credentials.
3. **Token Generation:** After successfully saving the new user to the database, the server generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate the newly created user. This token contains the user's information and is signed using a secret key stored in the environment variables. The JWT serves as a means of authenticating the user in subsequent requests without the need for re-entering credentials.
4. **Response:** Finally, the server responds with a status code of 201 (Created) along with a JSON object containing the newly created user's information and the generated JWT token. This allows the client to obtain the necessary credentials for further authentication and access to protected resources.

## **Error Handling:**

In the event of an unexpected error during the registration process, such as a database connection error or an internal server issue, the server responds with a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error). This informs the client that something went wrong on the server side and prompts them to try again later.

## **Key Takeaway:**

The `/signup` endpoint serves as the entry point for new users to register with our application. By following a series of steps, including username availability check, user creation, token generation, and response delivery, the endpoint ensures a smooth and secure registration process for our users.
