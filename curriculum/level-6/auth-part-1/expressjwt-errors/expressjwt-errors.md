# Understanding `express-jwt` and Error Handling in Express.js

In this lesson, we'll explore how to secure your Express.js application using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) and the `express-jwt` middleware. We'll also see how to handle errors that arise from invalid or missing tokens.

## Protecting Routes with `express-jwt`

To protect routes in your application, you can use the `express-jwt` middleware. Here's the key line of code:

```jsx
app.use('/api/main', expressjwt({ secret: process.env.SECRET, algorithms: ['HS256'] }));

```

### What Does This Do?

1. **Route Protection**:
    - The middleware `expressjwt` is applied to the `/api/main` route. This means that any request to a route starting with `/api/main` will require a valid JWT.
2. **JWT Verification**:
    - The `expressjwt` middleware checks the incoming request for a JWT in the Authorization header.
    - It verifies the token using the secret key provided (`process.env.SECRET`). This secret key must match the one used to sign the token.
    - The `algorithms` option specifies that the token must be signed using the `HS256` algorithm, ensuring a secure and consistent method of token signing and verification.
3. **Securing Your API**:
    - By adding this middleware, you ensure that only clients with a valid token can access the protected routes. This is crucial for securing sensitive endpoints, like those involving user data or actions requiring authentication.

## Adding the Payload to `req.auth`

One of the powerful features of `express-jwt` is that it automatically adds the decoded JWT payload to the `req` object as `req.auth`. This allows you to access user information within your route handlers easily.

```jsx
app.get('/api/main/protected', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.auth); // Logs the JWT payload
    res.send(`Hello ${req.auth.username}, this is a protected route`);
});

```

### What Does This Do?

1. **Accessing User Information**:
    - The JWT payload, which might contain user information like `id` and `username`, is available in `req.auth`.
    - This makes it easy to personalize responses or enforce user-specific logic within your protected routes.
2. **Simplified Route Handlers**:
    - Instead of manually decoding the JWT in each route handler, you can rely on `express-jwt` to do it for you. This keeps your code clean and consistent.

## Handling Errors with Middleware

When the `expressjwt` middleware detects an invalid or missing token, it throws an error. We need to handle this error gracefully to inform the client about what went wrong. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```jsx
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.log(err); // Log the error for debugging
    if (err.name === "UnauthorizedError") {
        res.status(err.status); // Set the response status to 401 Unauthorized
    }
    return res.send({ errMsg: err.message }); // Send a JSON response with the error message
});

```

### What Does This Do?

1. **Error Logging**:
    - The error-handling middleware logs the error to the console, which helps in debugging issues by providing details about what went wrong.
2. **Specific Error Handling**:
    - The `if` statement checks if the error's name is "UnauthorizedError", which is the error thrown by `expressjwt` when the JWT is invalid or missing.
    - If this is the case, it sets the response status to the error's status code (typically 401 Unauthorized), indicating that the client must provide valid authentication credentials.
3. **Sending a Response**:
    - Regardless of the error type, the middleware sends a JSON response with an error message (`err.message`). This informs the client about the nature of the error.

## Summary

Using `express-jwt` to protect routes ensures that only authenticated users can access certain parts of your application. The middleware automatically decodes the JWT and adds the payload to `req.auth`, simplifying access to user information within your route handlers. The error-handling middleware allows you to manage authentication errors effectively, providing clear feedback to the client while helping you debug issues on the server side. This setup is essential for building secure and robust applications.
