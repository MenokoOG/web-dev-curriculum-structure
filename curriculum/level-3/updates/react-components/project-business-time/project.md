# Project: Business Time with React

### Task Overview

You have been tasked with creating a simple React project using Vite. The goal is to build and render a basic web page for a fake business. This project will help you practice building and styling components in React.

### Requirements

1. **Create Three Components:**
    - **Header:** This component will serve as the top section of your webpage.
    - **Main:** This component will be the central part of your webpage.
    - **Footer:** This component will be the bottom section of your webpage.
2. **Render All Three Components:**
    - Ensure that the `Header`, `Main`, and `Footer` components are correctly rendered on the page.
3. **Style the Components:**
    - Style each component so that they are positioned correctly on the page. The `Header` should be at the top, the `Main` in the middle, and the `Footer` at the bottom.
4. **Fill Each Component with Content:**
    - **Header:** Include the business name and a navigation menu.
    - **Main:** Provide a brief description of the business, its services, and any other relevant information.
    - **Footer:** Add contact information, business hours, and any other footer details.

### Additional Notes

- **Content:** Feel free to get creative with the content. The business can be anything you imagine, from a coffee shop to a tech startup.
- **Navigation Links:** The links in the `Header` component should not be functional; they are for appearance only.
