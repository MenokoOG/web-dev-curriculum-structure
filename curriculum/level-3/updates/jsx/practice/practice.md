## First React Practice

### Objective:

Create a simple React application using Vite. This exercise will help you understand the basics of setting up a React project, clearing boilerplate code, rendering content using variables, and applying inline styling.

### Instructions:

1. **Create a Vite App:**
    - Set up a new Vite app in your terminal.
2. **Clear Out Boilerplate Code:**
    - Open your project in your preferred code editor.
    - Remove all unnecessary boilerplate code, including emptying the `index.css` file and deleting the `App.css` file. Ensure your `App.jsx` contains an empty function ready for your code.
3. **Render an `<h1>` on the Page:**
    - Inside the `App` function, add an `<h1>` element that will render on the page.
4. **Create Variables and Use Them:**
    - Create a variable to store a string value.
    - Create an object variable to store inline styling.
    - Use the string variable's value as the text content of the `<h1>` element.
    - Apply the object variable as inline styling to the `<h1>` element.
5. **Run Your App:**
    - Save all your changes.
    - In the terminal, start the development server and view your app in the browser.

Good luck, and have fun with your first React practice!
