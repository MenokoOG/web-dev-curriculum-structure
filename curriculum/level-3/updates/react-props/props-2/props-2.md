### Props Pt. 2:  Destructuring props

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. **Understand Data Mapping in React**: Explain the purpose and benefits of using the `.map` method to iterate over arrays and create JSX elements or custom components dynamically.
2. **Implement Props in Custom Components**: Use props to pass data from a parent component to child components, enhancing the reusability and dynamic nature of components.
3. **Utilize Unique Keys for Elements**: Demonstrate the importance of assigning unique `key` props to elements generated by mapping over arrays to ensure efficient rendering and updating by React.
4. **Create and Render Custom Components**: Build custom components that receive and display data through props, showcasing the practical application of mapping and props in React development.



# Mapping Data in React: Creating JSX Elements and Custom Components

### Introduction

In React, mapping over arrays of data to create JSX elements and custom components is a powerful technique for rendering dynamic content. This approach improves code efficiency, readability, and maintainability. This document will guide you through the important concepts and demonstrate how to map data to create custom components.

### Key Concepts

- **Mapping Arrays**:
    - The `map` method is used to iterate over an array and create a new array of elements.
    - Each element in the new array can be a JSX element or a custom component.
- **Using Props**:
    - Props (properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
    - This enables components to be reusable and dynamic.
- **Unique Keys**:
    - When mapping over arrays to create elements, each element must have a unique `key` prop.
    - This helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

### Example Code

Here's an example of a React app that demonstrates these concepts by mapping over an array of skateboard objects and creating custom components for each item.

```jsx

import { useState } from 'react';
import Navbar from './components/Navbar';
import Store from './components/Store';
import Skateboard from './components/Skateboard';

function App() {
  const storeName = 'SkateShop';

  const skateboards = [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "Street Cruiser",
      size: "8.0",
      style: "Street",
      design: "Classic Black",
      price: 75.99
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: "Pro Trickster",
      size: "8.25",
      style: "Park",
      design: "Flame Graphics",
      price: 89.99
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      name: "Vert Master",
      size: "8.5",
      style: "Vert",
      design: "Skull and Bones",
      price: 95.00
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      name: "Longboard Cruiser",
      size: "9.0",
      style: "Cruising",
      design: "Palm Trees",
      price: 120.49
    }
  ];

  const skateboardElements = skateboards.map(board => {
    return (
      <Skateboard key={board.id} {...board} />
    )
  })

  return (
    <>
      <Navbar name={storeName} />
      <Store name={storeName} skateboards={skateboards}/>
      {skateboardElements}
    </>
  )
}

export default App;

```

### Breakdown

- **Mapping the Data**:
    - The `skateboards` array is mapped over to create `skateboardElements`.
    - Each `board` object in the array is passed as props to the `Skateboard` component.
- **Using Props**:
    - The `Skateboard` component receives props using the spread operator (`...board`), which passes all properties of the `board` object as individual props.
    - Inside the `Skateboard` component, these props can be accessed and used to render the content dynamically.
- **Unique Keys**:
    - The `key` prop is added to each `Skateboard` component using `board.id`. This ensures that each element in the array has a unique identifier, which is essential for React's reconciliation process.

### Conclusion

Mapping over arrays to create JSX elements and custom components is an essential skill in React development. It allows you to handle dynamic data efficiently and make your components reusable. By understanding and implementing these concepts, you can build scalable and maintainable React applications.
