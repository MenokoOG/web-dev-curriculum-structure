## Objective

Your task is to re-create the first page of the [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/) sample website. This exercise will help you practice structuring a React application and passing data through components.

### Requirements

1. **Component Structure:**
Organize your React app into the following components:
    
    ```jsx
    <Header />
        <Navbar />
    <BlogList />
        <BlogPost />
    <Footer />
    
    ```
    
    - **Header** should include the **Navbar** component.
    - **BlogList** should include the **BlogPost** component.

    3. **Design and Styling:**
    - Ensure that the blog text is overlaid on the image and styled consistently with the design of the sample site.
    - Focus on making the page visually appealing and aligned with the overall aesthetic of the Clean Blog template.
    - Experiment with styling to achieve a polished look within a focused timeframe.

### Passing Criteria

- Your app should correctly render the blog page layout with the data provided.
- The components should display the blog posts with the appropriate titles, subtitles, authors, and dates.
- The page should be styled to ensure the text is clearly readable over the images and is visually appealing.

By completing this assignment, you will gain experience in component-based architecture, data handling in React, and implementing responsive design.
