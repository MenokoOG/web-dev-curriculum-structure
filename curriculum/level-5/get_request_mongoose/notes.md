## Understanding Mongoose Queries with Async/Await and Error Handling in Express

In this section, we will break down a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to use Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database in an Express application. We'll cover Mongoose queries, the `async/await` syntax, and error handling with `try/catch`.

### Code Snippet

```jsx
const Movie = require('../models/movie')

movieRouter.get('/', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const foundMovies = await Movie.find()
        return res.status(200).send(foundMovies)
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500)
        return next(error)
    }
})

```

### Explanation

### 1. Introduction to Mongoose and the `Movie` Model

- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is a powerful ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It allows you to define schemas and interact with MongoDB using models.
- **Movie Model**: The `Movie` model is imported at the top of the file with `const Movie = require('../models/movie')`. This model represents a collection of movie documents in the database, with its structure defined in a separate file (`../models/movie`).

### 2. Defining the Route Handler

- **Route Definition**: `movieRouter.get('/', async (req, res, next) => { ... })` sets up a GET route at the root path `/` of the `movieRouter`. When this endpoint is hit with a GET request, the provided callback function executes.
- **Async Function**: By marking the callback function as `async`, we can use `await` within it to handle asynchronous operations more seamlessly.

### 3. Performing a Mongoose Query with `await`

- **`Movie.find()`**: This is a Mongoose query that retrieves all documents from the `movies` collection. It returns a promise.
- **`await` Keyword**: The `await` keyword pauses the function's execution until the promise is resolved. Here, it waits for the `Movie.find()` query to complete and assigns the result to `foundMovies`.
- **Storing Results**: The fetched movie documents are stored in the `foundMovies` variable.

### 4. Handling Errors with `try/catch`

- **Try Block**: Code that might throw an error is placed inside the `try` block. In this case, the Mongoose query (`await Movie.find()`) is enclosed in the `try` block.
- **Catch Block**: If an error occurs during the query, the `catch` block is executed. The error object (`error`) provides details about what went wrong.
- **Error Response**: If an error is caught, the server responds with a 500 status code (`res.status(500)`), indicating an internal server error. The `next` function is called with the error to pass it to the next middleware for further handling, such as logging or sending a more detailed error response to the client.

### 5. Sending the Response

- **Successful Query**: If the query is successful, the server sends a 200 status code (`res.status(200)`) along with the array of found movies (`foundMovies`).

### Summary

This code demonstrates a typical pattern for querying a MongoDB database using Mongoose in an Express application:

- **Mongoose Query**: `Movie.find()` retrieves all movie documents.
- **Async/Await**: `async` and `await` are used for handling asynchronous database operations in a clear and readable manner.
- **Try/Catch**: This pattern is used to manage potential errors, ensuring the application can handle failures gracefully.

By understanding this example, you can see how to effectively integrate Mongoose with Express to perform database operations while maintaining clean and robust code.
